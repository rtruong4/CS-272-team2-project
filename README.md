# CS-272-project-team2

The environment is created to prioritize safe driving of the agent by testing it within the highway environment, creating additional lanes, other vehicles, construction zones, etc. 

The environment is made to make sure the agent's driving is safe and predictable to other agents, minimizing the number of potentially dangerous actions, such as going outside of speed limit, unnecessary movements on the road and driving in prohibited areas. 

The following should be considered when trying to maximize the reward:

Agent crash

Agent lane change

Agent going outside of optimal speed limit

Agent driving inside the construction zone

Agent moving forward

Agent going inside the speed limit


Termination:

Successfully traveled for 120 seconds

Had a crash - unsuccessful termination
